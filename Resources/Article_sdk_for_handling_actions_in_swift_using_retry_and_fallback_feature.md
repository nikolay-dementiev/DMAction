# The Challenges of Retry Logic and Fallback Mechanisms in App Development

Every developer, at some point, faces the same recurring challenges: retrying failed actions and providing fallback mechanisms when all attempts fail. These problems are especially common in scenarios like network requests, background tasks, or user interactions. For instance:

- What happens if a network request fails due to a temporary issue? Should your app crash, or should it retry the request automatically?
- If all retries fail, how do you ensure your app doesnâ€™t leave users stranded? Should there be a fallback action to notify the user or log the error?

These are not just hypothetical scenarios â€” theyâ€™re real-world problems that every developer encounters sooner or later. Solving them manually often leads to repetitive, error-prone code thatâ€™s hard to maintain. For example, implementing retry logic might involve nested loops, timers, or complex state management. Similarly, fallback mechanisms require additional checks and alternative workflows, which can quickly clutter your codebase.

So, how can we solve these problems elegantly? One powerful solution lies in **composition**: breaking down complex workflows into smaller, reusable components. By composing actions, retries, and fallbacks, you can create a clean, modular system thatâ€™s easy to test and maintain.

This is where **DMAction**, a library I recently published, comes into play. DMAction provides a robust framework for handling retries and fallbacks in Swift applications. It abstracts the complexities of action management into reusable, protocol-oriented components, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than boilerplate code.

## Introducing DMAction: The Elegance of Composition

At its core, **DMAction** (henceforth simply `this SDK`) is a lightweight yet powerful SDK designed to simplify action handling in Swift applications. Whether youâ€™re working with UIKit or SwiftUI, this SDK provides a clean and intuitive API for managing retries, fallbacks, and asynchronous operations â€” all while adhering to the principles of composition.

Hereâ€™s how this SDK solves the two critical problems mentioned earlier:

### 1. Retry Mechanism

Imagine fetching data from a server. If the request fails due to a temporary network issue, you donâ€™t want to leave your users hanging. With this SDK, you can define a retry mechanism that automatically retries the request up to a specified number of times before failing gracefully.

```swift
let action = DMButtonAction {
    print("Performing task...")
}
let retriedAction = action.retry(3)
retriedAction { result in
    switch result.unwrapValue() {
    case .success(let value):
        print("Success: \(value)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failed after retries: \(error)")
    }
}
```
This snippet demonstrates how this SDK handles retries seamlessly, saving you time and effort. Instead of writing nested loops or managing state manually, you simply specify the number of retries, and this SDK takes care of the rest.

### 2. Fallback Support
What happens if an action fails completely, even after retries? This SDK allows you to define fallback actions to ensure your app remains robust. For example, if a form submission fails, you can provide a fallback action to notify the user or log the error.

```swift
let primaryAction = DMButtonAction {
    print("Primary action performed")
}
let fallbackAction = DMButtonAction {
    print("Fallback action performed")
}
let actionWithFallback = primaryAction.fallbackTo(fallbackAction)
actionWithFallback.action { result in
    // Handle result
}
```
This ensures your app never leaves users stranded, even in the face of failure. By combining retries and fallbacks, this SDK creates a resilient system that gracefully handles errors.

## How Does DMAction Work?
This SDK is built on a protocol-oriented architecture, making it flexible and easy to integrate into any project. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key components:

1. The DMAction Protocol:
 - Defines the blueprint for actions.
 - Includes properties like currentAttempt, id, and action.
 - Provides utility methods like fallbackTo and retry.
2. Retry Mechanism:
 - Automatically retries failed actions up to a specified number of attempts.
 - Ensures resilience in network requests, background tasks, and more.
3. Fallback Behavior:
 - Executes a secondary action if the primary action fails.
 - Ensures graceful degradation of functionality.
4. Simplified Execution:
 - Use simpleAction to execute actions without worrying about result handling.
