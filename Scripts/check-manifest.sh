# Checks what a consumer of the package gets, and what the repository's own tooling does
# on the machine of whoever runs it.
#
#   Scripts/check-manifest.sh
#
# 1. The manifest has no dependency by branch or revision, uses no plugin on any target
#    and does not read the environment. SwiftPM refuses a version requirement on a package
#    that has an unstable dependency, a build plugin of a dependency runs in every
#    consumer's build, and a manifest that reads the environment describes more than one
#    package.
# 2. A consumer that asks for the package by version resolves it. This runs against a
#    throw-away tagged copy of the tracked manifest and sources: a consumer that depends
#    on the checkout by path cannot show that failure.
# 3. Fixtures/Consumer builds. It uses every released public declaration and the shapes
#    the downstream package relies on, so if it stops building, a consumer's code stops
#    building.
# 4. No tracked file under Examples/ deletes a directory tree. The example's Pod helper
#    used to delete the Xcode DerivedData folder of the whole machine on every install.
#    This is a text search: it catches that spelling again, it does not prove that a
#    script has no side effect.
